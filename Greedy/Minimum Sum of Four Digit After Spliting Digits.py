# This code snippet takes a number, converts it to a string,
# sorts the digits in ascending order, and then performs a specific 
# concatenation and summation operation on the sorted digits. Here's a breakdown:
class Solution(object):
    def minimumSum(self, num):
        num = sorted(str(num))
        # This line converts the input number num into a string, sorts the digits of the string in ascending order, and stores the result back into the variable num.
        i, j = 0, len(num) - 1
        # Initializes two pointers i and j to the start and end of the sorted num array respectively.
        res = 0
        #Initializes a variable res to store the result of the summation.
        #The while loop while i < j: iterates until i becomes greater than or equal to j.
        res += int(num[i] + num[j])
        # Inside the loop, 
        #it concatenates the i-th digit of num with the j-th digit of num,
        #converts the concatenated string into an integer, and adds it to res.
 #i += 1 and j -= 1: These lines increment i and decrement j to move towards the center of the sorted num array.

# Finally, return res returns the accumulated result.
# Overall, this code concatenates the smallest digit of the sorted num with the largest one,
# the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, 
# until it reaches the middle. It sums up these concatenated integers and returns the result.
